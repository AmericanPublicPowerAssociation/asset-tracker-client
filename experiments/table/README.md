# Table Prototypes

Comparing 3 table libraries.
Based on research and implementation of features, I have found Tabulator to be the best option taking into account pricing, features offered, and ease of use.

## Getting Started

Download the .html files of your choice and open them via web browser. You can view the code as well in your favorite IDE.

## Functionalities Included

01. Sort columns
02. Filter columns by value
03. Edit values directly in table
04. Show alert after clicking on row

## Differences Between the 3 Table Libraries

### Tabulator
* Free license (?)
* Recent commit to GitHub (https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator) - regular maintenance
* Works with major frameworks
* Create complex tables with simple code

### agGrid

* Over 1500 companies use agGrid
* Recent commit to GitHub (https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid) - regular maintenance
* Perpetual license - pay first time and own; pay for upgrades
* Enterprise, SaaS license fees
* Easiest to implement with the least amount of code
* Documentation is easy to follow
* Works with major frameworks

### DataTables

* plugin for the jQuery JavaScript library
* provides searching, sorting and pagination without configuration
* Editing is a paid component of DataTables that is required for editing the table cells
* Used by famous companies such as Adobe, AT&T, Apple, etc.
* Infrequent commits to GitHub (https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables) - irregular maintenance
* Does not work well with major frameworks because jQuery plays entirely in the DOM (https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/31761/anyone-use-datatables-with-reactjs)
